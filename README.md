## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its main purpose is to allow users to write in an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format, which can be converted into structurally valid HTML. It is often used for formatting README files, writing messages in online discussion forums, and creating rich text using a plain text editor.
